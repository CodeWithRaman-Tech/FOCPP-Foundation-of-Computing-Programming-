## Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

In this module, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, including **ChatGPT**, were used to support my learning and understanding of Python programming concepts.

AI was used primarily for the following purposes:

* To understand fundamental Python concepts such as **variables, conditional statements, loops, and functions**
* To view simple and clear examples of Python code for learning and reference
* To help explain programming errors and understand why they occur
* To learn how to write **clean, readable, and well-commented code**
* To gain ideas on how to **structure programs, projects, and my programming portfolio**

All code included in this portfolio was **reviewed, tested, and fully understood by me**. I did not blindly copy any code generated by AI tools. Instead, I modified the code where necessary, tested it thoroughly, and added my own comments and explanations to demonstrate my understanding.

AI tools were used strictly as a **learning aid**, similar to a tutor, reference book, or online documentation. Their use helped improve my understanding of Python programming as well as related concepts in **cyber security and computing**.

I confirm that this work represents **my own learning and effort**, and that Artificial Intelligence was used only as a **supportive educational tool**, in accordance with academic integrity guidelines.
