**Fundamentals of Computer Programming**

# **Week 1 – Introduction to Computer Programming**


## **1. What is a Computer Program?**

A **computer program** is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do.
It follows three main steps:

**Input → Processing → Output**

* **Input**: Data given to the program (keyboard, file, mouse, etc.)
* **Processing**: The program works on the data
* **Output**: The result shown to the user (screen, file, etc.)

Programs are written by **programmers** using **programming languages**.
These languages allow humans to write instructions that computers can understand and execute .


## **2. Why We Use Programming Languages**

Computers only understand **machine code** (numbers).
Programming languages help humans write instructions in a readable form, which are then translated into machine code so the computer can run them .


## **3. Generations of Programming Languages**

Programming languages have developed in stages:

### **1GL – First Generation**

* Machine code (only numbers)
* Very difficult to write and understand
* Different for each type of computer

### **2GL – Second Generation**

* **Assembly language**
* Uses short words (mnemonics) instead of numbers
* Still difficult and different for each CPU
* Converted using an **Assembler**

### **3GL – Third Generation**

Most modern languages:

* Examples: **C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript**
* Easier to read and write
* Translated using a **Compiler** or **Interpreter**
* Python is a 3GL language 

### **4GL – Fourth Generation**

* More human-friendly
* Focus on *what* to do, not *how* to do it
* Examples: **SQL, R, SPSS**
* Used for special purposes like data analysis 


## **4. Python Programming Language**

Python is:

* Easy to learn
* Widely used in industry and education
* Supports **procedural**, **functional**, and **object-oriented** programming
* Used in areas like:

  * Artificial Intelligence
  * Data Science
  * Cyber Security
  * Digital Forensics 

Python is a very good first programming language for beginners.

## **5. Python Interpreter and IDE**

### **Python Interpreter**

* Works in **interactive mode**
* Uses **REPL**:

  * Read
  * Evaluate
  * Print
  * Loop
* Allows you to type code and get instant results 

Example:

>>> 10 + 5
15


### **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**

* Software used to write large programs
* Includes:

  * Code editor
  * Debugger
  * File management
* Easier for large projects than using only the interpreter 



## **6. Python Libraries**

Python uses **libraries** which contain ready-made code.

They:

* Save time
* Avoid writing the same code again
* Make Python very powerful

Python has:

* A large **Standard Library**
* Many **third-party libraries** for data science, visualization, security, etc. 


## **7. Expressions in Python**

An **expression** is a combination of numbers and operators.

Example:

45 + 20


* **Operands**: 45, 20
* **Operator**: +

The interpreter shows the result immediately in interactive mode .

## **8. Common Python Operators**

| Operator | Meaning        |
| -------- | -------------- |
| `+`      | Addition       |
| `-`      | Subtraction    |
| `*`      | Multiplication |
| `/`      | Division       |
| `//`     | Floor division |
| `%`      | Remainder      |
| `**`     | Power          |



## **9. Operator Precedence**

Python follows rules to decide which operation happens first:

Order:

1. `()` Parentheses
2. `**` Power
3. `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`
4. `+`, `-`

Example:

10 + 5 * 2 = 20

Multiplication happens before addition .


## **10. Errors in Programming**

Errors are normal in programming.

### **Types of Errors**

**1. Syntax Errors**

* Wrong spelling or wrong code structure
* Easy to fix
* Example: missing brackets

**2. Logical Errors**

* Program runs but gives wrong result
* Harder to find
* Caused by wrong logic

These mistakes are called **bugs** .


## **11. Fixing Errors**

* Read error messages carefully
* Syntax errors are shown before the program runs
* Logical errors must be found by testing
* Runtime errors show a **traceback** to help locate the problem .

## **12. Week 1 Key Learning Summary**

* A program gives instructions to a computer
* Python is a 3rd generation programming language
* The Python interpreter allows quick testing
* Expressions and operators are basic building blocks
* Errors are normal and must be fixed carefully
* Always read error messages to find problems
